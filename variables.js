A lot of the sounds used in this song harken back to early Skrillex songs that we loved when we were first falling in love with electronic music. The ‚Äúoh f*ck‚Äù sample before the 2nd drop is from some random video we found online of a small rocket exploding or something like that. We thought it was a hilarious video and the sample just worked perfectly in the song."

		blurb: "A lot of you might recognize this song from hearing it on the Euphoria Tour (it had the Gasolina vocal on it but sadly couldn‚Äôt clear that sample for the tape). Moombahton had a big influence on us when we were first starting out and is still a genre we love to play out in Playground Sets. This song feels like an homage to the old Dillon Francis, Munchi, and Porter Robinson. The name is obviously a play off the word moombahton."

We later changed it because this song felt like it took you somewhere else that the other songs didn‚Äôt, and we wanted to save that moment for later in the project. That‚Äôs part of the reason why we chose to have this song animated in the film. It‚Äôs a drastic change that feels like it breathes new life into the tape in the second half."

I can‚Äôt even tell what the lead sound at the drop sounds like, it‚Äôs like an airy door stopper being flung back and forth or something, and the breakdancer in the video crushed it!
